Display custom map locations on a Mapbox-powered map complete with voice guided navigation, animated routes, offline caching and media galleries.

== Description ==
GN Mapbox Locations with ACF creates a **Map Location** post type for storing coordinates, descriptions and images. Place the `[gn_map]` shortcode anywhere to display an interactive map. A draggable navigation panel gives visitors driving, walking or cycling directions with spoken instructions that can be muted. Routes can be animated and paused or resumed, while a service worker caches tiles for offline use. A debug panel outputs verbose logs when enabled. Visitors can submit photos or videos from the front end which administrators approve before publishing. Example locations are automatically imported if none exist.

== Features ==
* "Map Location" custom post type storing coordinates, descriptions and galleries.
* `[gn_map]` shortcode embeds an interactive Mapbox map anywhere.
* `[gn_mapbox_giolou]` shortcode displays a map of Giolou with a marker and red boundary line around the village.
* `[gn_mapbox_giolou_paphos]` and `[gn_mapbox_paphos_airport]` show driving directions between key locations.
* Responsive popups show images, descriptions and a media upload form.
* Gallery items open in a lightbox and scale to any screen.
* Draggable navigation panel for driving, walking or cycling directions with voice guidance.
* Voice instructions can be muted or unmuted and support multiple languages.
* Animated route line with optional elevation graph and statistics.
* Debug panel outputs verbose logs on screen and to the browser console.
* Offline map tile caching via service worker.
* Visitors may upload photos or videos on the front end; admins can approve or delete each submission before publishing.
* Upload forms automatically appear in map popups and inside each location post.
* Example locations from `data/nature-path-1.json` and `data/nature-path-2.json` are imported when none exist.
* Automatic update checks from GitHub.
* Ready for translation and WPML compatible.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu.
3. Enter your Mapbox access token under **Settings → GN Mapbox**.

== Debugging ==
Enable the Debug Panel option in **Settings → GN Mapbox** to output verbose logs to the browser console.
Markers are logged in the order they appear in `data/nature-path-1.json` and `data/nature-path-2.json`.
