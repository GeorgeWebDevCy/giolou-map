# GN Mapbox Locations with ACF

This WordPress plugin displays custom post type locations on a Mapbox map. It allows visitors to view markers, follow routes and even get spoken navigation.

## Features
 - "Map Location" custom post type stores coordinates, descriptions and unlimited gallery media.
- `[gn_map]` shortcode embeds a fully interactive Mapbox map anywhere on your site.
- `[gn_mapbox_giolou]` shortcode shows Giolou with a marker and red boundary line around the village.
- `[gn_mapbox_giolou_paphos]` and `[gn_mapbox_paphos_airport]` provide driving directions between popular destinations.
 - Responsive popups display images, descriptions and media upload forms.
 - Gallery items open in a lightbox that scales beautifully on all devices.
- Draggable navigation panel offers driving, walking and cycling directions with voice guidance.
- Map labels and voice guidance follow the selected language.
- Spoken instructions use the browser speech API and can be muted or unmuted at any time.
- Animated route line with optional elevation graph and real-time statistics.
- On-screen debug panel and console logs when debugging is enabled.
- Service worker caches Mapbox tiles so viewed maps continue working offline.
- Visitors can upload photos or videos from the front end; admins can approve or delete submissions before publishing.
- Upload forms automatically appear in map popups and inside each location post.
- Example locations from `data/nature-path-1.json` and `data/nature-path-2.json` are imported if none exist.
- Built-in update checker fetches new versions directly from GitHub.
- Ready for translation and WPML compatible.

## Installation
1. Upload the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate it through the WordPress "Plugins" screen.
3. Enter your Mapbox access token in **Settings → GN Mapbox**.

## Usage
Create `Map Location` posts with latitude and longitude fields and place the `[gn_map]` shortcode on any page.

## Approving Uploaded Media
After visitors submit photos or videos, they appear under **Media → Photo Approvals** in the WordPress admin. Review each item and either **Approve** it to publish in the location gallery or **Delete** it permanently.

## Debugging
Enable the **Debug Panel** setting under **Settings → GN Mapbox** to output detailed logs to the browser console and on-screen panel.
Markers are logged in the order they appear in `data/nature-path-1.json` and `data/nature-path-2.json`.

## Offline Caching
A service worker caches Mapbox tiles for offline use once a page has been loaded online. The map will then continue working with the cached tiles when the network is unavailable.

## Default Locations
If no `Map Location` posts exist, the plugin imports the coordinates from
`data/nature-path-1.json` and `data/nature-path-2.json` into the custom post type. When the JSON fallback is used
at runtime, those locations are also created as posts so all features keep
working. Update this file to change the built-in locations.
